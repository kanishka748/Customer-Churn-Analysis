📊 Customer Churn Analysis (EDA)
This project explores customer churn behavior in a telecom dataset using detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA). The objective is to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights that can help reduce churn and improve customer retention.

📁 Project Overview
Goal: Identify key factors associated with customer churn.

Dataset: Telco customer churn dataset (commonly used in Kaggle projects).

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Key Insights
Overall churn rate: ~26.54%

Tenure: Customers with less than 6 months of tenure show highest churn (~50%)

Contract type: Month-to-month users are far more likely to churn compared to 1- or 2-year contracts

Payment methods: Electronic check users have the highest churn rate

Services: Users with fiber optic internet and streaming services show increased churn

📊 Visualizations
Churn distribution by:
Contract Type
Tenure (Binned)
Payment Method
Internet Service and Streaming Features
Stacked bar charts with percentage labels for comparison
Heatmaps for feature correlation (if applicable)

🧠 Business Recommendations
Focus on early retention for new customers
Promote long-term contracts with incentives
Improve service for fiber optic users
Encourage automatic payment methods to reduce churn

📌 Future Work
Build a churn prediction model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
Deploy as an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI
A/B test retention campaigns based on insights
